TPS 1

	1.)

	2.)

	3.)

	4.)

	5.) We don't need to declare n in the data segment and we can get rid of la and lw for n.

	6.)


TPS 2

	1.) As the name implies it is recursive so its going to output a lot of returns of either 1 or 3.

	2.)

	3.)

	4.) We can put it inside of a temporary register like $t0 or $a0

	5.) The returned value is always put into register $v0 or $v1 so we can put that value inside of a temporary register like $t0 or $a0 and then print out the value.

	6.)

	7.) There are 3 integer values reserved in this storage. The first thing to be stored on the stack would be the return address $ra. sw $ra, 8($sp)

	8.) 

	9.)

	10.) we need to save $a0 into the stack because when the function recursion gets called again it changes the value in $a0, so we save it to not lose it.

	11.) addi $a0, $a0, -2

	12.) 

	13.) addi $a0, $a0, -1

	14.)

	15.) we need to lw $ra to be able to go back to main.
