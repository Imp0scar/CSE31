	1.)

	2.)

	3.)

	4.) A machine instruction contains 32 bits

	5.) There are 3 types, they are I-format, R-format, and J-format

	6.) 

		a.)
			The addi instruction is an i-format where it has 4 fields, the first is the opcode(6 bits), the second is the rs(source register/ 5 bits), the third is the rt(target register/ 5 bits) and finally the immediate which is 16 bits, this sums up to the 32 bits 

		b.)
			The value of the opcode in hex is 0x8, the register in rs would be $zero which in hex is 0x0. The register in rt would be $s0 and the value in hex is 0x10

		c.)
			binary: 0010 0000 0001 0000 0000 0000 0001 1001
			0x20100019
	7.)
		a.)
			the machine code at this address in hex is 0x0230402a.
			In binaray its 0000 0010 0011 0000 0100 0000 0010 1010.
		b.)
			The instruction type is R format because the first 6 bits are 0 in hex and I know this is slt because the last two bits are 2a which I saw in the mips reference sheet to be slt. There are 6 fields.
			1.) opcode - 6 bits
			2.) rs - 5 bits
			3.) rt - 5 bits
			4.) rd(destination register) - 5 bits
			5.) shamt - 5 bits
			6.) funct - 6 bits
		c.)
			According to the binary version of this machine code the value of each field in hex would be 
			opcode rs   rt   rd   shamt   funct
			0x0    17   16   8      0       2a
		d.)
			This instruction is slt and the mappings of registers would be 
			slt $t0, $s1, $s0
		e.) the final mips instructions is slt $t0, $s1, $s0 which matches what I got.
	8.)
		a.) this is an I format.
		b.) the value of opcode is 0x5, rs is 0x8, rt is 0x0 in hex.
		c.)The name of the target label is Less if it takes the branch and the address of this label is 0x1 in hex.
		d.)we just convert hex to binary and have 15 bits which are 0 with 1 bit at the end being 1.
		e.) the immediate field value is 1 because it is 1 instruction starting from the 1st instruction below bne to get to the Label Less.
		f.) the machine code of this instruction in binary is 
		0001 0101 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0001
		in hex format its:
		0x15000001 which matches the code column.

	9.)
		a.)the j instruction is of j format, there are two fields.
		b.)the opcode of this instruction is 2 hex or 0x2.
		c.)The label it jumps to is Greq and its address is 0x00400030
		d.) we look at the lowest 26 bits in the address and shift by 2. the value of the address field in binary is 00 0001 0000 0000 0000 0000 1100
		e.)the machine code this instruction in binary is:
		0000 1000 0001 0000 0000 0000 0000 1100
		which in hex format is:
		0x0810000c.
