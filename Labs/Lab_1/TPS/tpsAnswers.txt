TPS 2
1a.) You can open more than one terminal from your linux computer.
1b.) I think that its more efficent and you can multi task several different programs of code without having to move everytime.

2.) You can tell what the contents are inside the current directory by using the command ls

3.) You can navigate to your desktop directory by using the command cd ~.

4.) You would do mkdir CSE31.

(how to install and use gcc, in video) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLjN6jAg-sY

3.) you would type gcc main.c

4.) you would know it compiled successfully if you dont get an error.

5.) the -c flag allows gcc to compile.

6.)	the -g flag allows gcc to debug.

7.) you can change the name from main to cselab1 by doing the command:
mv main cselab1

8.)	If you only compile with gcc main.c then you won't be able to output the results of your code.

9.) In order to run the program you would do gcc -o out main.c
